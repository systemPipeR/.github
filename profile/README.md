## Overview

The systemPipe project provides a suite of R/Bioconductor packages for designing, building, and executing end-to-end data analysis workflows on local machines and high-performance computing (HPC) systems, while simultaneously generating publication-quality analysis reports.

This website serves primarily as a landing page that provides a high-level overview of each package and links to their corresponding pages on Bioconductor. Detailed usage instructions, examples, and technical documentation are available in the package vignettes hosted on Bioconductor (linked below).
